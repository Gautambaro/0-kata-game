0-kata-game is a classic two-player game that is simple yet strategic. It is played on a 3x3 grid 
where each player takes turns marking a square with their symbolâ€”either "X" or "O". 
The objective of the game is to be the first player to place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
The game concludes when a player achieves this goal, or when all squares are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw. 
This game is a great way to develop problem-solving skills and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.


How to Play
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
One player is "X" and the other player is "O". Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
